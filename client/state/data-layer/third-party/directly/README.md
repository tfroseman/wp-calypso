Directly data-layer
===================

[Directly](https://www.directly.com/) is an on-demand customer support tool. Read more
about Directly and how it's used in Calypso in the [`lib/directly` README](../../../../lib/directly/README.md).

This data-layer integration executes the imperative Directly API commands when
corresponding Redux actions are intercepted.
